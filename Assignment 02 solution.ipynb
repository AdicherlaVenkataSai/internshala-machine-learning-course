    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Your client is a financial distribution company. Over the last 10 years, they have created an offline distribution channel across the country. They sell financial products to consumers by hiring agents in their network. These agents are freelancers and get a commission when they make a product sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of your client onboarding process\n",
    "\n",
    "The managers at your client are primarily responsible for recruiting agents. Once a manager has identified a potential applicant he would explain the business opportunity to the agent. Once the agent provides the consent, an application is made to your client to become an agent. In the next 3 months, this potential agent has to undergo a 7 days training at your client's branch (about sales processes and various products) and clear a subsequent examination in order to become an agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem - who are the best agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is obvious in the above process, there is a significant investment which your client makes in identifying, training, and recruiting these agents. However, there are a set of agents who do not bring in the expected resultant business. Your client is looking for help from data scientists like you to help them provide insights using their past recruitment data. They want to predict the target variable for each potential agent which would help them identify the right agents to hire.\n",
